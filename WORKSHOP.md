# Proposed Workflow

  * Clone branch `hands-on`
  * Checkout to a new branch
  * Perform the following tasks:
    * Create a `start` script to serve and watch the app
    * Install `typescript` version 3.7.4
    * On `app.ts`, type the button property to be `HTMLElement`
    * Complete the `LogPerformance` decorator and test it
    * Complete the `Throttle` decorator and test it
